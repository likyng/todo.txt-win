# About todo.txt win
todo.txt win is a todo.txt client for windows 10 devices. It works on mobile, tablets and normal computers and supports a part of todo.txt's protocol.
While complete support is planned down the road, you can already use the app with your existing todo.txt files. It will not alter them in a way which makes them unsusable.
